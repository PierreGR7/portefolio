In this project, I will analyze a [vehicle dataset available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho){:target="_blank"}, focusing on exploring market trends through data visualization and developing a predictive model using training and test datasets.

You can check, download and modify my code on kaggle at the following links:
