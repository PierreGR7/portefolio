In this project, I will analyze a [vehicle dataset available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho){:target="_blank"}, focusing on exploring market trends through data visualization and developing a predictive model using training and test datasets.

You can check, download and modify my code at the following link: [Pierre's data analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pierregraef/data-analysis-visualization-predict-linear-reg){:target="_blank"}.

This version is more structured and presents the project in a polished, professional manner. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
